Communication Process

- Sending the message and receiving the message
- receiver is interpreting the message received
- message is effective or not?
- reduce the noise/distractions


Strategic Conversation
- Think through the impact you want to have on the receiver
- What message do you want that person to take away from what you are communicating?

one chance to create that perception and you want to make the most of it

Elements of Strategic Conversation
- Open Communication
    - Understanding what information you have to give
    - Making yourself vulnerable by sharing details that will allow the person receiving the information to recognise your credibility  

- Effective listening
    - If you are communicating with somebody to be sure that they are actually understanding, you need to be listening loudly to them
    - You want to understand whether or not they are receiving the message
        (focus on the conversation, paraphrase back)

- Discernment
    - How we perceive or how we judge the information that we are receiving
    - We want to be sure that the receiver is perceiving it in the right way
        (Received literally and in a positive manner to which you were trying to convey your message)

- Dialogue
    - A communication between two or more individuals where you are gaining a shared vision, a shared agreement, you re emotionally tied to the subject

Body Language

Formal Communication
- A report is on a lower end of channel richness
- Moving along the continuum includes; memos, instant messaging, etc.
- The richest channel of communication is face to face    

Use the face to face way of communicating as well as following up in writing to be sure that you are documenting it

Informal Communication
- You can send out a memo to the organisation
- You might want to write a personal letter to somebody
