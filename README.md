What is Communication?
Aristotle defined communication as
ethos, pathos and logos

ethos:
- Who you are?
- Your credibility?
- Why should somebody listen to you?  
- What are your credentials?
- Why should somebody hear what it is you have to say?

pathos:
- Why should I care?
- How are you going to connect with me emotionally?
- How are you going to get your message across and make it important to me?

logos:
- Thats your logic, how are you going to get your message across?
- What channels and what means are you going to use to help me to understand what it is you are trying to say

Communication is about
- your credibility in giving the message
- why should I care
- what method are you going to use to make me understand

ethos: Who are you?
pathos: Why does this matter to me?
logos: How are you going to get this logic across?
